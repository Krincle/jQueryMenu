            <div class = "title">The Wisdom of Father Brown by C. G. Chesterton
                <div class = "info">A mixture of witicism, philosophy and a most unique writing style found in a classical writer, who is so beyond his time, he implements postmodernist techniquest in his short stories, unprecedented, but somewhat similar in originality to the works of Frederico Garcia Lorca, and in depth to Guy de Maupassant.</div>

            <div class = "title">The Brothers Karamizov by Fyodor Dostoyesky
                <div class = "info" style= "display:none">Alyosha Karmizov is a protogonist because he represents action, but the main character remains Ivan Karamizov, the brother who represents thought, ideas, and knowledge. He is critical to understanding the theme of the novel, Grushenka's wisdom and Katerina Ivanova's capricious and cruel vanity. There is a permise that with Ivan's death, justice will never be accomplished. In her cruelty Katy will punish Mitia and keep him from leaving Syberia and marrying Grushenka. If Katya cannot find happiness herself, she wishes misery on everyone else, but this is so deep in her subconcious that few people can see this side of her. Ivan must and will survive to uncover the evil hidden insdie this lady of darkness to the world, and ironically Ivan will survive because Katy herself will tend to him with the greatest care, the most adroid lies and the most skilled pysicians. Alyosha does not have the capacity to understand Katy's iniquity and if Ivan dies, evil prevails, and he will lose both his brothers.</div>
